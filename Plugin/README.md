# Enhancement Tool Plug-in:
===========================

Enhancement tool is integrated within the DICE IDE as a plug-in (popup menu) . Since both DICE FG and DICE APR need to invoke the Matlab functions in Java class, the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) should be installed and runtime environment should be configured. Furthermore, DICE APR also requires the Epsilon Framework to perform the M2M transformation. The details of how to use Enhancement Tool Plug-in can be found in DICE IDE Cheat Sheets. doc folder also provides instruction of using Enhancement Tool Plug-in. 

Enhancement tool also has standalone version (i.e., [DICE-Enhancement-FG](https://github.com/dice-project/DICE-Enhancement-FG) and [DICE-Enhancement-APR](https://github.com/dice-project/DICE-Enhancement-APR)).
